- Using Joi npm package for validation. (use "npm i joi" to install it).
- Using bcryptjs npm package for hashing the password. (use "npm i bcryptjs" to install it).
- Using jsonwebtoken npm package for generating the token. It creates a token and we store and just show it to tell that we are already logged in So, do not need to login again and again.(use "npm i jsonwebtoken" to install it).
